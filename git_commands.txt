Work with .gitignore -- how to ignore files and folders that you dont want to check-in e.g. files and folders created by IDEs ? 
Steps: 
	- create a .gitignore file in the root directory. Correct way to create the same is use command "touch .gitignore" from git bash
	- add the desired files and folders to the .gitignore file that you want to ignore
	- e.g - for Intellij IDEA - it creates out folder to store the .class files
		To ignore this write "out/*" in the gitingnore file --> this will ignore the out folder with all its files.
		we also need to remove all the .iml files that are implicitly created by IDE
		Type *.iml in the .gitignore file
